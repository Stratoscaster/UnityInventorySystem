This project is entirely based on the tutorial by Coding With Unity on YouTube. Please see their tutorial, and others, for more in-depth explanations in the links at the bottom.

Many aspects of the original project were changes due to stylistic preferences, architectural improvements, or added features to make using the system on the backend a little easier. Feel free to use it if you find it useful at all.
